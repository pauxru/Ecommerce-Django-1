## Project Summary

The website displays products. Users can add and remove products to/from their cart while also specifying the quantity of each item. They can then enter their address and choose Stripe to handle the payment processing.

## Project Note

I created the project while learning Django like in 2019. A startup was interested in it and I sold it to them to use for their site. Recently, the startup moved from django to Node.js stack due to their needs. I am now posting this here as a reminder of some of the work I have done with django.
